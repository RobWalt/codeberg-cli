# Guidelines

- IMPORTANT: Please stick to the [conventional commits format](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). We recommend using tools like [cocogitto](https://github.com/cocogitto/cocogitto) to enforce this. It will be checked in the CI and bigger PRs not following these rules should be reworded. Otherwise there is always the option to ask the maintainers to squash your commits. Maintaining this commit format is important since we create our changelog through it.
